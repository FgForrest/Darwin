/**
 * Basic version accessor implementation. It serves to identify component name and version that is coming up in the application
 * setup and to compare with version that is already deployed in database.
 *
 * Although it was usually connected with Maven POM version it is discouraged now (after experience with such doing).
 * It's better to version data model independently to application version and update version only when patch is added.
 * It allows you to deploy several patches in single application version and this is better for iterative development
 * practises.
